\section{Limitations of Existing Solutions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lack of Trust and Verification:}
    Many influencer platforms do not verify the credibility of influencers or brands, which can result in fraud, fake profiles, or unreliable partnerships.
    Influencify provides a verified platform where both influencers and clients go through a rigorous verification process. Influencers can showcase their real social media metrics and profiles, ensuring that both parties can trust each other’s legitimacy.
    
    \item \textbf{Fragmented Communication:}
    Influencers and brands often communicate via informal channels like social media DMs, leading to miscommunication, delays, or misunderstandings. There’s no centralized record of conversations.
    Influencify integrates in-app chat functionality using Firebase Realtime Database, which allows clients and influencers to directly communicate within the platform. All conversations are logged, ensuring that there’s a clear, transparent record of discussions and agreements.

    \item \textbf{Unreliable Payment Systems:}
    Influencers face delayed or inconsistent payments after completing promotional tasks, and platforms often lack a secure and transparent payment process.
    Influencify uses a secure escrow payment system through integrated payment gateways like Razorpay or Stripe. The payment is held in escrow until the influencer completes the task, and only when the client confirms the work, is the payment released to the influencer. This ensures fair and timely transactions for both parties.

    \item \textbf{Limited Customization for Clients:}
    Existing platforms may not offer the right tools for clients to filter and find influencers who match their specific needs, or to customize promotion packages.
    Clients on Influencify can search and filter influencers based on multiple parameters such as category, platform, followers, price range, and more. Additionally, clients can send customized promotion requests based on specific requirements, ensuring a better match between the brand and influencer.

    \item \textbf{Absence of Task Tracking and Milestones:}
    Many platforms fail to provide a structured system for task tracking, leading to confusion about deliverables and timelines.
    Influencify introduces a milestone-based system where each task is tracked from creation to completion. Influencers and clients both know what’s expected, and payments are only processed after the client confirms the deliverables. This reduces ambiguity and ensures smoother workflows.

    \item \textbf{Inefficient Dispute Resolution:}
    In case of issues or disagreements, many platforms offer minimal dispute resolution support, leaving users to handle conflicts without clear processes.
    Influenciy includes a dispute resolution system where the admin team can intervene if any issues arise between influencers and clients. This ensures that both parties have a neutral, fair process to address conflicts and concerns.

    \item \textbf{No Collaboration Opportunities:}
    Many platforms don’t encourage collaboration between influencers, missing the potential for co-created campaigns and organic growth.
    Influencify promotes influencer-to-influencer collaborations, where influencers can connect with each other to collaborate on campaigns, exchange ideas, and co-create content. This not only benefits influencers but also fosters organic growth and cross-promotion.
